Simple project for managing expenses using Rust as main programming language, and Actix web as framework to manage our project.
First, once you clone the repository. 
Create an .env file adding your `DATABASE_URL` I used postgresql as main database, you can use whatever you want but you have to manage any changes in the project.

This is a simple CRUD app for testing and learning how Actix web works.
SO enjoy and if you have any tips on how to make an API.
